#you can give names to the actions or values
#and these names are called as variables.

name = input("What is your name? ") 
#value of input is stored in a variable called name.
print ("Hello " + name) 

name = input("What is your name? ") 
length = len(name)
print(length)

#naming rules of variables
	#1 - try to give understandable names dont give names like l, a, b.
    #2 - names are always a single word, wrong - name val, right - name_val
    #3 - names can have numbers but names cant start with numbers.
    	#like - wrong - 1player
        # 		right - player1
    #4 - do not miss spell names it will generate a compiler error.
    	#name = shubham
        #print(nama) ERROR
